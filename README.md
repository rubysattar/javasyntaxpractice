## Java syntax practice
In this repo, you can find practice files I used to better understand Java fundamentals like
- System.out.printIn()
- Array syntax
- Looping syntax

# Command Line
From the command line, I am navigating to the files I want to run for testing my pactice code. After installing a JDK, I am able to run ```javac < the file path >``` to compile the code into a class, then I can run ```java < the file path of the newly compiled class >``` for my console to return any output.

# Please excuse the following as they are not standard and were used for practice purposes:
- naming conventions
- file structure
